If you want to use a customized CouchDB configuration, you can create your configuration file in a directory on the host machine and then mount that directory as /opt/couchdb/etc/local.d inside the couchdb container.

$ docker run --name my-couchdb -v /home/couchdb/etc:/opt/couchdb/etc/local.d -d couchdb
The -v /home/couchdb/etc:/opt/couchdb/etc/local.d part of the command mounts the /home/couchdb/etc directory from the underlying host system as /opt/couchdb/etc/local.d inside the container, where CouchDB by default will write its dynamic configuration files.

You can also use couchdb as the base image for your own couchdb instance and provide your own version of the local.ini config file:

Example Dockerfile:

FROM couchdb

COPY local.ini /opt/couchdb/etc/
and then build and run

$ docker build -t you/awesome-couchdb .
$ docker run -d -p 5984:5984 you/awesome-couchdb
